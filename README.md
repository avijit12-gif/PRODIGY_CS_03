# Password Strength Checker 
Just built a Password Strength Checker in Python! This script evaluates password strength based on key criteria: length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides a rating from "Very Weak" to "Very Strong" and gives clear feedback on how to improve weak passwords.

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of regular expressions (regex), input validation, conditional logic, and user-friendly feedback systems. Excited to keep learning and building more!
